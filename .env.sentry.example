# Sentry Configuration (TEMPLATE)
# Copy keys (and only placeholders) into your environment (Render or .env for local).
# Do NOT commit real DSNs or secrets.

# Minimal required
SENTRY_DSN=<your-sentry-dsn>                    # e.g., https://public@sentry.io/<project-id>
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development                  # development | staging | production
# Optional: override auto-detected release (we recommend computing from GIT SHA in code/CI)

# Performance sampling (0.0 to 1.0). Keep low in production to control cost.
SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.10                  # % of transactions to trace
SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.00                # profiling is off by default

# Optional server name override (otherwise Sentry will infer)
SENTRY_SERVER_NAME=routeforce-api

# --- Application-level flags (not read by Sentry automatically) ---
# Your app can read these to control behavior; they are NOT Sentry SDK settings.
RF_IGNORE_404_ERRORS=true                       # use in before_send filter
RF_IGNORE_HEALTH_CHECK_ERRORS=true              # use in before_send filter
RF_SLOW_API_THRESHOLD_SEC=5.0                   # custom threshold used by app metrics
RF_SLOW_FUNCTION_THRESHOLD_SEC=1.0              # custom threshold used by app metrics

# Note:
# - FLASK_ENV is an application/runtime flag; keep it in your primary .env, not here.
# - The SDK does NOT recognize RF_* keys by itself â€” implement filtering in code.
