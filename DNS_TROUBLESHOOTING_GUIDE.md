# DNS Troubleshooting Guide for RouteForce Pro

## Current Status (Updated - July 20, 2025)
- ✅ **Netlify Build**: Successfully completed (152 files uploaded, 44s build time)
- ✅ **DNS Record**: CNAME for `app` → `routeforcepro.netlify.app` (being added)
- ⏳ **DNS Propagation**: Starting now (15min - 24hrs)
- ✅ **Files**: All 159 deployment files are present
- 🎯 **Action**: Save the DNS record and wait for propagation

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Netlify Deployment (Priority 1)
The direct Netlify URL is returning 404, which means either:
- The build failed
- The publish directory is incorrect
- The site needs to be redeployed

**Steps to fix:**
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Find your `routeforcepro` site
3. Check the "Deploys" tab for any failed builds
4. Verify these settings in Site Settings:
   - Build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
   - Node version: 18 or higher

### 2. Manual Redeploy Option
If auto-deploy isn't working, you can manually deploy:

```bash
# Build the frontend locally
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# The dist folder should contain:
# - index.html
# - assets/ folder with JS/CSS files
# - Any other static assets
```

Then drag and drop the `frontend/dist` folder to Netlify's deploy area.

### 3. DNS Propagation Check
Once Netlify is working:
- DNS propagation for `app.routeforcepro.com` can take 15 minutes to 24 hours
- You can check propagation status at: https://dnschecker.org
- Test with: `nslookup app.routeforcepro.com`

### 4. Verify Netlify DNS Settings
In Netlify Dashboard > Domain Settings:
- ✅ `app.routeforcepro.com` should point to `routeforcepro.netlify.app`
- ✅ SSL should be enabled
- ✅ DNS records should show CNAME: `routeforcepro.netlify.app`

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test Netlify direct URL
curl -I https://routeforcepro.netlify.app

# Test DNS propagation
nslookup app.routeforcepro.com

# Alternative DNS test
dig app.routeforcepro.com

# Check from different DNS servers
nslookup app.routeforcepro.com 1.1.1.1
nslookup app.routeforcepro.com 8.8.8.8
```

## Expected Results When Working

### Netlify Direct URL
```
HTTP/2 200 
content-type: text/html
```

### DNS Lookup
```
app.routeforcepro.com
CNAME   routeforcepro.netlify.app
```

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Netlify deployment first** (without this, DNS won't matter)
2. **Wait for DNS propagation** (once Netlify is working)
3. **Test the full flow** (app.routeforcepro.com → working RouteForce app)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures
- Check Node.js version (needs 16+)
- Verify package.json scripts
- Check for missing dependencies

### 404 Errors
- Wrong publish directory
- Missing index.html in build output
- Build process not completing

### DNS Issues
- Incorrect CNAME value
- Wrong domain configuration
- Propagation delay (normal)

## Contact Info
If issues persist:
- Check Netlify build logs
- Verify frontend builds locally
- Ensure all environment variables are set
