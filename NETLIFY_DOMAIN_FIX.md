# URGENT FIX - Netlify Domain Configuration

## 🚨 Root Cause Identified
From your Netlify Dashboard screenshot, I can see:
- ❌ **DNS verification failed**
- ❌ **"routeforcepro.com doesn't appear to be served by Netlify"**

## 🎯 The Problem
You've added `app.routeforcepro.com` as a custom domain, but Netlify is expecting the **root domain** (`routeforcepro.com`) to also be configured or verified.

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE FIX (Choose Option A or B)

### Option A: Fix Domain Configuration (Recommended)
1. **In Netlify Domain Management**, click "Add custom domain"
2. **Add the root domain**: `routeforcepro.com` 
3. **Set up these DNS records in Squarespace**:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: app
   Value: [your-actual-netlify-url].netlify.app
   ```

### Option B: Remove Custom Domain (Quick Test)
1. **Temporarily remove** `app.routeforcepro.com` from Netlify
2. **Find your actual Netlify URL** (should be like `your-site-name.netlify.app`)
3. **Test that URL directly**
4. **Re-add custom domain** once we confirm the site works

## 🔍 Find Your Real Netlify URL

**Method 1: Check Site Settings**
- Go to Site Settings → General → Site details
- Look for "Default subdomain" or "Site URL"

**Method 2: Look at Deploy Preview**
- Click on any deploy in "Deploys" tab
- Look for preview URL (not deploy-preview, the main one)

**Method 3: Check Site Overview**
- Go back to main site dashboard
- Should show the `.netlify.app` URL at the top

## 🧪 Test Commands (Once You Have Real URL)

```bash
# Replace YOUR-SITE-NAME with actual site name
curl -I https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.netlify.app

# Example patterns to try:
curl -I https://routeforce-pro.netlify.app
curl -I https://routeforce.netlify.app
curl -I https://routeforcepro-app.netlify.app
```

## 📋 What You Should Find
The correct Netlify URL should return:
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: text/html
```

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Find the real `.netlify.app` URL** first
2. **Test it works** (shows RouteForce app)
3. **Then fix domain configuration**
4. **Wait for DNS propagation**

## 💡 Quick Win
If you can find the working `.netlify.app` URL, you can:
- Share it with users immediately
- Use it for testing while DNS propagates
- Verify everything works before domain setup

**Priority: Find the actual working Netlify URL first, then fix domain config!**
