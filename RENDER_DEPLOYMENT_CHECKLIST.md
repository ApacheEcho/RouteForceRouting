### 4. Docker Configuration
- [ ] Verify Dockerfile.production builds successfully
- [ ] Test Docker image locally
- [ ] Configure Docker Hub credentials

## Deployment Steps

### Staging Deployment
1. Push to `main` branch triggers staging deployment
2. Monitor deployment in Render dashboard
3. Run health checks: `./scripts/deploy-render.sh health --environment staging`
4. Validate application functionality

### Production Deployment
1. Create release branch: `git checkout -b production`
2. Push to `production` branch triggers production deployment
3. Monitor deployment carefully
4. Run comprehensive health checks
5. Validate all endpoints and functionality

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure Sentry error tracking
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Configure alerts for service failures
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Configure caching strategies
- [ ] Review and adjust resource allocations

## Rollback Procedure
If deployment fails:
1. Run: `./scripts/deploy-render.sh rollback --environment production`
2. Investigate issues in logs
3. Fix problems and redeploy
4. Document lessons learned

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy-render.sh deploy --environment staging

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy-render.sh deploy --environment production

# Check deployment status
./scripts/deploy-render.sh status --environment production

# View deployment logs
./scripts/deploy-render.sh logs --environment production

# Run health checks
./scripts/deploy-render.sh health --environment production

# Rollback deployment
./scripts/deploy-render.sh rollback --environment production

# Validate configuration
./scripts/deploy-render.sh validate
```
