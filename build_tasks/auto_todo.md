# üõ†Ô∏è RouteForcePro ‚Äì Autonomous Build Queue (8-Hour Sprint)

## ‚úÖ Core Routing & Scoring Enhancements
- [x] Integrate route scoring engine into main route pipeline
- [x] Finalize score weight config (distance, priority, traffic, playbook penalties)
- [x] Add summary route score at end of each generated route
- [x] Write route score export to `/logs/route_scores/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- [x] Add per-store score justification log (penalties, bonuses)

## üß† Constraint & Playbook Injection
- [x] Inject playbook constraints into routing logic (hours, skip days, chain rules)
- [x] Add natural language rule support via `rules_parser.py`
- [x] Build fallback handling for playbook overrides
- [x] Validate playbook constraints with test suite

## üîç QA Engine & Preflight
- [x] Build `qa_engine.py` to validate route integrity (no duplicates, no empty days)
- [x] Inject QA preflight into route generation step
- [x] Log QA results to `logs/qa/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- [x] Build auto-correction suggestion engine (e.g., missed high-priority store)

## üîÑ Store Input + Error Handling
- [x] Add advanced CSV parsing (auto-detect schema, warn on mismatch)
- [x] Build store-level validation (`store_validator.py`)
- [x] Add `store_errors.log` file and route generator skip logic
- [ ] Build retry queue for failed uploads

## üß≠ UX + Route Display
- [ ] Build interactive map route viewer (Leaflet.js or Mapbox wrapper)
- [ ] Add store stop time display (from playbook estimates)
- [ ] Inject route summary into `dashboard.html`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Meta Tasks (Autoloop Support)
- [ ] Self-generate next 5 tasks if list runs low (`autobuild.py`)
- [ ] Add random 1-minute pause between every 3 tasks to mimic human input
- [ ] Archive completed tasks to `archive/YYYY-MM-DD_done.md`
- [ ] Clean up unused log files older than 7 days
