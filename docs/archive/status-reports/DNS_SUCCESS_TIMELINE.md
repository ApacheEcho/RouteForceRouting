## ⏰ Timeline - What Happens Now

### **Next 15-30 Minutes:**

### **Up to 24 Hours:**
- Full global propagation complete
- All users worldwide can access `app.routeforcepro.com`

## 🧪 Testing Commands (Start in 15 minutes)

```bash
# Check DNS propagation
nslookup app.routeforcepro.com

# Test from different DNS servers
nslookup app.routeforcepro.com 8.8.8.8
nslookup app.routeforcepro.com 1.1.1.1

# Check if site loads
curl -I https://app.routeforcepro.com

# Alternative dig command
dig app.routeforcepro.com
```

## 🎯 Expected Results (When Working)

### **DNS Lookup Success:**
```
app.routeforcepro.com
canonical name = routeforcepro.netlify.app
```

### **Website Response:**
```
HTTP/2 200 OK
content-type: text/html
```

## 📊 Monitoring Progress

### **Check DNS Propagation Globally:**
- Visit: https://dnschecker.org
- Enter: `app.routeforcepro.com`
- Type: `CNAME`
- Watch the green checkmarks appear worldwide

### **Check Netlify Dashboard:**
- Go back to Netlify Domain Management
- Click "Retry DNS verification" (if available)
- Should show ✅ "DNS verification successful"
- SSL certificate should be issued automatically

## 🚀 What This Achieves

### **Production Setup:**
- ✅ `routeforcepro.com` → Squarespace (main marketing site)
- ✅ `www.routeforcepro.com` → Squarespace (www redirect)
- ✅ `app.routeforcepro.com` → Netlify (RouteForce application)

### **Professional Architecture:**
- Marketing site on Squarespace
- Web application on Netlify
- Clean subdomain separation
- SSL certificates on both

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. **DNS resolves**: `nslookup app.routeforcepro.com` returns the CNAME
2. **Site loads**: `https://app.routeforcepro.com` shows RouteForce
3. **SSL works**: Green lock in browser
4. **Netlify happy**: DNS verification passes in dashboard

## ⚡ Quick Win

While waiting for DNS, you can:
- Test the direct Netlify URL (once we find it)
- Prepare content for your Squarespace main site
- Document the architecture for your team
