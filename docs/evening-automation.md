# Evening Automation Documentation

## Overview
The evening automation workflow runs daily at 5:45 PM UTC to prepare the development workspace for evening coding sessions, ensuring everything is ready by 6:00 PM sharp.

## Schedule
- **Trigger Time**: 5:45 PM UTC daily
- **Expected Completion**: By 6:00 PM UTC
- **Manual Trigger**: Available via GitHub Actions UI

## Automation Steps

### 1. üîÑ Sync Morning Changes
- Fetches latest changes from the main branch
- Automatically merges any updates
- Ensures workspace is current with team changes

### 2. üß™ Run Test Suite
- Executes comprehensive pytest test suite
- 10-minute timeout protection to ensure timely completion
- Documents any test failures for evening review

### 3. üèóÔ∏è Prepare Evening Workspace
- Creates `evening-workspace/` directory
- Generates system status report
- Validates development environment
- Checks for uncommitted changes

### 4. üìã Generate Evening Priorities
- Analyzes recent commit activity for context
- Scans codebase for TODO/FIXME items
- Creates prioritized task list based on:
  - Recent development activity
  - Code analysis findings
  - Recommended development priorities

### 5. üéØ Final Workspace Validation
- Verifies all workspace files are created
- Validates Python environment
- Checks git status
- Confirms readiness for coding session

## Artifacts
The workflow generates artifacts that are preserved for 7 days:
- `evening-workspace/status.md` - System and workspace status
- `evening-workspace/priorities.md` - Evening coding priorities
- `evening-prep-log.txt` - Any issues or failures encountered

## Manual Execution
To manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Evening Pre-Coding Automation"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch and click "Run workflow"

## Troubleshooting
- **Workflow Fails**: Check the Actions logs for specific error details
- **Tests Timeout**: Workflow continues but logs test failures for review
- **Missing Artifacts**: Check if the workflow completed successfully

## Timezone Considerations
The workflow is scheduled for 5:45 PM UTC. To adjust for your local timezone:
- Edit `.github/workflows/evening-automation.yml`
- Modify the cron expression: `'45 17 * * *'`
- Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to calculate your desired time

## Integration with Development Workflow
This automation complements the existing morning automation (4:55 AM EST) to provide:
- Morning: Initial workspace setup
- Evening: Comprehensive preparation and priority setting
- Continuous: Regular CI/CD pipeline execution

## Success Criteria
‚úÖ Workspace ready by 6:00 PM  
‚úÖ Latest changes synchronized  
‚úÖ Test suite executed  
‚úÖ Priorities generated  
‚úÖ Environment validated  

The workflow ensures a smooth transition into evening coding sessions with all necessary preparation completed automatically.
