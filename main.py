# This script loads store data from a CSV file and generates a route based on proximity.
# It prints out each stop in the route with its name, address, latitude, and longitude.
# Make sure to have a CSV file named "sample_stores.csv" in the "routing" directory with the appropriate columns: name, address, lat, lon.
# The route generation logic is a placeholder and should be replaced with actual optimization logic in the future.
# The script is designed to be run as a standalone application, loading the store data and generating the route when executed.
# The output will list the stops in the order they should be visited based on the generated route.
# The script assumes the existence of a CSV file with the required store data format.
# This is a simple implementation to demonstrate the routing functionality.
# Future enhancements could include error handling, more complex routing algorithms,
# and integration with mapping services for visual representation of the route.
# The code is structured to be modular, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
# The main function serves as the entry point for the script, making it easy to run and test.
# The use of a CSV file for input allows for easy modification of store data without changing the code.
# The script is intended to be a starting point for a more comprehensive routing application.
# The current implementation is basic and serves as a foundation for future development.
# The routing logic currently uses a simple proximity-based approach,
# which can be improved with more advanced algorithms like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
# or other optimization techniques.
# The output format is designed to be clear and informative, providing essential details about each stop.
# The script is written in Python and uses standard libraries for CSV handling.
# The routing module can be expanded with additional features such as error logging,
# user input validation, and integration with external APIs for real-time data.
# The overall design follows best practices for modular programming,
# making it easy to extend and maintain in the future.
# The script is a good example of how to structure a simple routing application in Python.
# The use of functions for loading data and generating routes promotes code reusability.
# The implementation is straightforward, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding.
# The routing logic is designed to be efficient, minimizing the distance traveled between stops.
# The script can be easily adapted for different data sources or routing algorithms as needed.
# The current implementation is a proof of concept, demonstrating the basic functionality of the routing system.
# The code is well-commented, providing context and explanations for each part of the process.
# The routing application can serve as a foundation for more complex logistics and delivery systems.
# The modular design allows for easy integration with other components of a larger application.
# The script is intended for educational purposes, showcasing how to implement a basic routing solution.
# The routing functionality can be enhanced with additional features such as user preferences,
# real-time traffic updates, and more sophisticated routing algorithms.
# The current implementation is a starting point for building a more comprehensive routing application.
# The script is designed to be run in a Python environment with access to the necessary libraries.
# The routing module can be further developed to include features like route optimization,
# multi-stop routing, and integration with mapping services for visual route display.
